# GraphQL Profile Dashboard - .gitignore
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# ============================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES
# ============================================================================

# Node.js dependencies installed via npm/yarn
# These packages are defined in package.json and can be reinstalled
# Excluding them keeps the repository lightweight and avoids version conflicts
/node_modules

# Yarn Plug'n'Play files
# Yarn 2+ uses PnP instead of node_modules for faster installs
# These are generated files that should not be committed
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# ============================================================================
# TESTING
# ============================================================================

# Test coverage reports generated by testing frameworks
# These are auto-generated and contain detailed coverage statistics
# They change frequently and are better generated locally or in CI/CD
/coverage

# ============================================================================
# PRODUCTION BUILD
# ============================================================================

# React production build output directory
# Contains optimized, minified files ready for deployment
# Generated by 'npm run build' and should not be version controlled
/build

# ============================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT & CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# macOS system file that stores folder display settings
# Not relevant for the project and differs between machines
.DS_Store

# Environment variable files containing sensitive data
# These may contain API keys, database credentials, or configuration secrets
# Each environment (local, development, test, production) has its own file
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
